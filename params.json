{"name":"Daq-eclipse","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to daq-eclipse\r\nThis is a project for redefining the data acquisition software created by Diamond Light Source. With the GDA9-Solstice project, for the first time data acquisition will be available as a spring configured binary. This project is a module in the solstice binary and can be used without the GDA9-Solstice EPICS devices by implementing an OSGi service to redefine all devices or by using extension points to add new devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis repository is maintained by the Diamond Light Source core team. Please contact @gerring if you think you should be added as a commiter.
